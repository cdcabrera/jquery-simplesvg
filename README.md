<h1>jQuery.SimpleSVG</h1>
<p>
    jQuery SVG plugin, meant to display SVG in supported browsers. Unsupported browsers simply
    receive alternate content. Also provided a few methods for adding/removing classes from SVG elements,
    and various other aspects.
</p>

<h2>Browser compatibility</h2>
<p>
    Tested in Firefox, Chrome, Opera, and everyones favorite IE flavors 7-9. IE 7 and 8 will display the unsupported content. IE 9
    has basic SVG support.

    I did reference Keith Wood's work on his <a href="http://keith-wood.name/svg.html">SVG for jQuery v1.4.5 plugin</a> for what class methods
    to return/allow. His plugin was dual licensed under the GPL and <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT License</a>.
